Project Title: Marketing Ala Carte || Sushi Market
8:00
Project Description: Online ala carte  marketing services menu (with a sushi theme) where the marketing company has hired us to create a menu (survey) that they will send to their potential clients to check off what services they need and then check-out.
8:02
User Story 1: As a marketing agency we want to have a unique way to gather service requirements from our potential customers. We've hired you to create an online sushi themed menu of services that our potential clients will fill out to describe what they want.
8:03
User story 2: I am a business looking for marketing services, but don't need everything. I am using this online survey to select the services I want and get a quote.
