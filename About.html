  <div class="col-sm-4-8 aboutDes">Unity 3D Certified, currently in a full-stack developer boot-camp, and looking to work with a company remotely.  I approach projects with a combination of technical know-how, ease with people, and high aesthetic standard. Throughout my life, I've intermingled the energies from both the left and right sides of the brain to bring artistry to my technology and tech-savvy to my artistic endeavors. I enjoy people and technology, am prolific if given the chance and guidance, and a life-long learner. I seek a company that can encourage these ambitions and advance both of our interests</div>
